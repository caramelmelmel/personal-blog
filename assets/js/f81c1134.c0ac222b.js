While I understand that this post is highly controversial to many because of the dark history of racism, I decided to understand history this time and why black history is actually essential for understanding.\\n\\nAs key figures like Martin Luther King even got himself named a Martin Luther King Street in every American city, I decided to focus on not so well-understood figures this year.\\n\\nFor this year, I decided to focus on Henrietta Lacks, a black american woman whose cells contributed greatly to the world of health sciences and research.\\n\\n## Who is Henrietta Lacks\\n\\nHenrietta Lacks was a black woman who grew up in an improverished African American family. She was a tobacco farmer in her early life and had two children. Here\'s the catch! Herietta Lacks contributed to the world of biological sciences even as a tobacco farmer because of her cells.\\n\\nIn case you didn\'t know, cancer is from the uncontrolled divsion of cells in the body. It happens in both animals and humans. Cancer cells grew under the isolated environment where they divide uncontrollably.\\n\\nHenrietta Lacks got diagnosed with cervical cancer on August 8 1951 and eventually succumbed to cancer and passed away on October 4 1951.\\n\\nHer cells eventually was used to developed the Hela cell line, which is used heavily in medical research to develop the Polio Vaccine, cancer research primarily in stem cell research and space exploration.\\n\\n## Interesting Areas of Henrietta Lacks in history\\n\\nBack in the 1950s, black people (known as African Americans) were heavily deiscriminated due to the history of slavery in America where basically they were brought in as slaves to work on ships, fields and all places not only without salary, but also how they were often abused by their employers.\\n\\nDiscrimination to this group of people not only ends here. Rights for obtaining employment, bank loan as well as consent for use of their body for research were also disregarded.\\n\\nIn the way where Henrietta Lacks was treated at John Hopkins Hospital, the only place where black patients were treated back then, her cancerous cervical cells were taken and used for research, without her consent or without her family\'s consent.\\n\\nThe catch about Henrietta cancer cells is that unlike normal cells, they divide uncontrollably even in the harshest environments like space and labs where normal cancer cells would die the next day. When her cell was examined for research, the genomic sequence of her cells is very different from other cancer cells which enabled the cells to escape apoptosis (programmed cell death).\\n\\nIt is because of her cell\'s ability to survive harsh conditions and her cells are able to divide at an excessive rate, it has taken to task for various pharmaceutical companies to develop what we know today as the HeLa cell line.\\n\\n## Significance\\n\\nBack when I was a Biology student in high school, we studied cancer and how cancer cells were used to advance scientific research in many areas. For the longest of time, the credit and use of her cells in research was not credited to Henrietta herself until her family found out years later. That eventually brought to light about how often the african americans were undermined even when brining good breakthroughs in the area of scientific research.\\n\\nEven in Singapore, we do everything with pure consent even if things had to be written out on paper. This also drives the issue of why consent is very important. Imagine having your social security details being shared to random people without your use of help. How would you feel?\\n\\nAs far as humans are concerned, our personal data even after death is still our details. It can be for malicious use against our loved ones.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAlthough black history is celebrated in only certain places, a lot of oppression of black history is still in place. Even if it\'s not history, every human still has rights but of course the world cannot be equal in everything that we have or do. Still, the obtaining of consent has to be done even until this day."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-03-01-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-01-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Docusaurus blogging features are powered by the blog plugin.","date":"2025-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Facebook","permalink":"/blog/tags/facebook","description":"Facebook tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello","description":"Hello tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus","description":"Docusaurus tag description"}],"readingTime":0.465,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Melody Leong","title":"Software Engineer","url":"https://caramelmelmel.github.io","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/melody-leong"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/caramelmelmel","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/melodyleongyunqin/","github":"https://github.com/caramelmelmel"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/caramelmelmel.png","key":"melody"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["melody"],"tags":["facebook","hello","docusaurus"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Black History Month 2025","permalink":"/blog/black-history-month"}},"content":"[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).\\n\\nHere are a few tips you might find useful.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nSimply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.\\n\\nRegular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.\\n\\nThe blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:\\n\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`\\n\\nA blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)\\n\\nThe blog supports tags as well!\\n\\n**And if you don\'t want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config."}]}}')}}]);
